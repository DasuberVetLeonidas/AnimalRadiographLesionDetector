89,Canine,Golden Retriever,13,Female,Yes,Osteosarcoma and DJD of Coxofemoral,Pelvic,318,"radiographs of the right tibia reveals the presence of an area of permeative lysis in the proximal tibia. This area involve the tibial crest, the tibial metaphysis, and the proximal tibial diaphysis. There is a poor zone of transition and soft tissue swelling. There is, however, no evidence of a periosteal reaction. As is the clinical concern, there is a pathologic fracture of the cranial cortex of the tibial crest. The appearance of this lesion is consistent with an aggressive disease process. Neoplasia or osteomyelitis are the two primary considerations. In an older patient, neoplasia is the primary consideration. It should be noted that the lesion is nonspecific for tumor type. This is an atypical location for a metastatic lesion so a primary bone tumor is considered most likely. Osteogenic sarcoma is a primary consideration but fibrosarcoma or chondrosarcoma should also be considered as osteogenic sarcomas are expected to have at least some degree of a periosteal reaction. Bilaterally, digit of joint disease is present in the coxofemoral joints. The degenerative change is greater in the right and the left. Given to change is noted in the right tibia, the significance of this address change in the talus is questionable."

The lesion is several centimeters proximal to the metaphysis, and is conical in shape. There is also smooth periosteal reaction on the diaphysis of the radius. This is extending from a bone plate in the proximal radius from previous surgery (image not included). "
